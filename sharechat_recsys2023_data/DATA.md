# Data

This folder is a placeholder for the raw training/testing data, as provided by the RecSys2023 Challenge organizers. 
The code expects two folders:

* train: folder containing the training data. The data is as presented for the competition, i.e., multiple csv files.  
* test: folder containing a single file named `000000000000.csv`, which will be used to generate the predictions.
